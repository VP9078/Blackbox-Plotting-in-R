# Blackbox-Plotting-in-R

Blackbox Plotting in R is a universal library for plotting Blackbox data output files in R, including summary data in the comma separated variable format, as well as features and tracking data in the hdf5 file format. This repository allows for any user of the Blackbox to easily visualize and analyze the quantitative data outputted by the software. Users can get started by sourcing any (or all) of the scripts into their RStudio. The scripts will load in functions which can be run in the interactive R console. Additional documentation is provided within the scripts. For any questions, contact vihaanpande08@gmail.com.
